1. You have a typing error so that your program produces the following result for part 3:
Vecter : y=(5,4,3,2,1,), x=2


2. For example, if I don't have the Homework 3 file, how can I know what you did with this code?
Thus, let's try to add a block comment like this
/*
Part 1: We will write a function with template to add two containters.
Part 2: ....
*/

And finally, it would be great if you give the description of each function you write.
For eg.,
/*
This function will ....
Input(s):
Output(s): 
*/
template <typename T> 
T add_containers(const T &x, const T &y)
{

}
