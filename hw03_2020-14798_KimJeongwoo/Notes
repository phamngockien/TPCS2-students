1. It would be great if you give the description of each function you write.
For eg.,
/*
This function will ....
Input(s):
Output(s): 
*/
template <typename T> 
T sum(const T &a, const T &b)
{

}

2. In part 3, you actually tested for std::vector<double>
Be careful when we copy some lines of code.

3. Your program might be easier to read if you split the code inside the function run_all_test() 
into several funtions. 
It is easier for users to read through a shorter function.
