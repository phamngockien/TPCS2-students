1. Your program might be easier to read if you split the code inside the function run_all_test() 
into several funtions. 
It is easier for users to read through a shorter function.

2. When running your program I got
/*
part1 test1 is passed 
part1 test1 is passed 
part1 test1 is passed 
part2 test1 is passed 
part2 test1 is passed 
part2 test1 is passed 
max func test is passed 
max func test is passed 
evaluation func test is passed 
evaluation func test is passed 
all_tests are passed
*/
The printed out messages confused me.

I have some comments here:
+ Try to remove the printing code out of the for loop
+ Be careful about what you want to print on the screen:
e.g, std::cout<<"part2 test1 is passed \n";
